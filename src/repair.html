      <h1>Step One: Assess the Damage</h1>
      <p class="p2">
        Assessing the damage means looking at the piano and figuring out what
        needs to be fixed. Please make a list of all the problems that you need
        to address, and then prioritize them based on how urgently they need to
        be fixed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Damaged Keys</li>
        <li>Cracked Cabinet or Frame</li>
        <li>Warped Piano Boards</li>
        <li>Water Damage</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Step two: Repair Any Damaged Keys</h2>
      <p class="p2">
        The third step is to repair any damaged keys. It may involve replacing
        broken keys, repairing cracked ones, or resetting loose ones. If you
        can’t do it yourself, you may need a professional piano technician.
      </p>
      <h2>Step Three: Fix Any Cracks in the Cabinet or Frame</h2>
      <p class="p2">
        This step may involve using wood glue or epoxy to repair the cracks. If
        the cracks are significant, you may require the assistance of a piano
        repair expert.
      </p>
      <h2>Step Four: Repair any Damaged Parts</h2>
